This is my learning journey into `data modeling`.

1. Linear Models:
Simple and multiple linear regression.
Modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables.

2. Logistic Regression:
Used for classification tasks where the response variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no).

3. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs):
Extensions of linear models that handle non-normal response distributions (e.g., Poisson regression for count data).

4. Time Series Modeling:
For analyzing temporal data, models like ARIMA, exponential smoothing, etc.

5. Decision Trees & Random Forests:
Non-linear models useful for both classification and regression tasks.

6. Model Evaluation:
Techniques such as cross-validation, residual analysis, and metrics like RMSE, MAE, and AUC to assess model performance.

7. Regularization Techniques:
Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net to handle overfitting and improve model generalization.

8. Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction:
Techniques like K-means clustering and PCA to group data and reduce complexity.

FILE: Data Exploration and Simple Regression Models

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Numerical and Graphical Summaries:
Summary statistics (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis) for understanding data distribution.
Graphical visualization using histograms, bar plots, and box plots to explore variable distributions and relationships.
Key Focus: Identifying trends, outliers, and patterns in data such as income, education, experience, and gambling behavior.
2. Correlation Analysis:
Correlation Coefficients:
Quantifying relationships between continuous variables (e.g., correlation between wages, education, and experience).
Key Focus: Understanding how strongly variables are associated with each other.
3. Linear Regression Modeling:
Simple Linear Regression:
Building basic models with one predictor (e.g., wage ~ educ or wage ~ exper).
Interpretation of coefficients, showing how changes in predictors (education or experience) affect the response (wage).
Key Focus: Predicting a dependent variable using a single independent variable.
4. Model Interpretation:
Coefficients:
Understanding the intercept and slope in regression models to explain the relationship between predictors and the response variable.
Key Focus: Translating mathematical regression equations into meaningful, real-world interpretations.
5. Statistical Testing (T-test):
Two-Sample T-Test:
Used to test whether there is a significant difference in wages between two groups (e.g., based on race).
Key Focus: Hypothesis testing to understand group differences.
6. Data Visualization for Modeling:
Scatter Plots:
Visualizing relationships between continuous variables (e.g., wage vs. education, wage vs. experience).
Boxplots:
Used to examine wage distribution across categorical variables like race.
Key Focus: Visual representation of data to aid in model understanding and interpretation.
