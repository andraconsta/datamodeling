This is my learning journey into `data modeling`.

- Linear Models:
Simple and multiple linear regression.
Modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables.

- Logistic Regression:
Used for classification tasks where the response variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no).

- Generalized Linear Models (GLMs):
Extensions of linear models that handle non-normal response distributions (e.g., Poisson regression for count data).

- Time Series Modeling:
For analyzing temporal data, models like ARIMA, exponential smoothing, etc.

- Decision Trees & Random Forests:
Non-linear models useful for both classification and regression tasks.

- Model Evaluation:
Techniques such as cross-validation, residual analysis, and metrics like RMSE, MAE, and AUC to assess model performance.

- Regularization Techniques:
Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net to handle overfitting and improve model generalization.

- Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction:
Techniques like K-means clustering and PCA to group data and reduce complexity.
