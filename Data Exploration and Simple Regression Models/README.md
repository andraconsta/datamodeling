FILE: Data Exploration and Simple Regression Models

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Numerical and Graphical Summaries:
Summary statistics (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis) for understanding data distribution.
Graphical visualization using histograms, bar plots, and box plots to explore variable distributions and relationships.
Key Focus: Identifying trends, outliers, and patterns in data such as income, education, experience, and gambling behavior.

2. Correlation Analysis:
Correlation Coefficients:
Quantifying relationships between continuous variables (e.g., correlation between wages, education, and experience).
Key Focus: Understanding how strongly variables are associated with each other.

3. Linear Regression Modeling:
Simple Linear Regression:
Building basic models with one predictor (e.g., wage ~ educ or wage ~ exper).
Interpretation of coefficients, showing how changes in predictors (education or experience) affect the response (wage).
Key Focus: Predicting a dependent variable using a single independent variable.

4. Model Interpretation:
Coefficients:
Understanding the intercept and slope in regression models to explain the relationship between predictors and the response variable.
Key Focus: Translating mathematical regression equations into meaningful, real-world interpretations.

5. Statistical Testing (T-test):
Two-Sample T-Test:
Used to test whether there is a significant difference in wages between two groups (e.g., based on race).
Key Focus: Hypothesis testing to understand group differences.

6. Data Visualization for Modeling:
Scatter Plots:
Visualizing relationships between continuous variables (e.g., wage vs. education, wage vs. experience).
Boxplots:
Used to examine wage distribution across categorical variables like race.
Key Focus: Visual representation of data to aid in model understanding and interpretation.
